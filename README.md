# Semester project Group-12
This repository is an exercice based on Big data systems. It regards a large dataset of bus and taxi information recieved on route. This data must be collected and shown to out users in a real time scenario. All data transformations must be linearly scalable. 

Each folder in this repository has it's own Readme file to explain how to use it. Feel free to navigate around
